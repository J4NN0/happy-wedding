# Happy Wedding

The core of the tool is a brute-force recursive algorithm that explores every possible way to assign guests to tables, in order to maximize the average mood at the wedding.

Each guest is assigned to one of the tables. For every complete assignment, the algorithm checks calculates the total mood for each table by summing the pairwise interactions of all guests seated together (as defined in a symmetric `N Ã— N` matrix), and computes the average mood across all non-empty tables. The objective is to find the assignment that results in the highest average mood per table.

While this brute-force approach guarantees the optimal result, it does not scale well. For larger inputs, approximations or heuristic-based methods (like greedy search or genetic algorithms) could offer practical runtime improvements with near-optimal results.

# Complexity

Let:
- `N` be the number of guests
- `K` be the number of tables
- `M` be the max number of seats per table
- `matr[i][j]` be the mood contribution between guest `i` and guest `j`

This approach explores every possible seating configuration, which leads to an exponential growth in time. Specifically, there are `K^N` total configurations, since each of the `N` guests can be placed on any of the `K` tables.

Each complete configuration is evaluated in `O(N^2)` time, due to the nested pairwise mood calculations across guest assignments. As a result, the overall time complexity is `O(K^N x N^2)`.

# Usage

1. Clone repo

       git clone https://github.com/J4NN0/happy_wedding.git
       cd happy_wedding
       
2. Make sure `banquet.txt` file exists and populate it accordingly
 
   1. First line of the file must contain respectively the values `N` (Number of guests), `K` (Number of tables) and `M` (Tables seats).
   2. The other lines form a symmetric matrix with all zeros in the diagonal (the diagonal of the matrix is zero because the person has no interaction with themselves). The value of each position indicates the interactions of the people with each other. For instance:
 
                  Trump Putin Renzi
            Trump   0    -2     3
            Putin  -2     0     1
            Renzi   3     1     0
  
   3. Names have to not be placed inside the file. Each person is identified by a number which is his position within the file. In the example above, Trump is identified by ID `0`, Putin `1` and Renzi `2`.
  4. The values of the interactions between people should be go from a minimum of `-5` to a maximum of `5`.
  5. An example of a file coudl be the following - `6 (5+1)` the number of guets, `2` the number of tables and `3` tables seats (for each table):
  
            6 2 3
            0 5 3 -2 1 1
            5 0 2 4 3 4
            3 2 0 1 5 -4
            -2 4 1 0 3 3
            1 3 5 3 0 2
            1 4 -4 3 2 0

 3. Make and run the program: the algorithm, through a recursive function, will calculate the average mood of the room and will give you each person's seating. 
 4. So, what are you waiting for? Sit down your guests appropriately!
