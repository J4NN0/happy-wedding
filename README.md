# Happy Wedding

Prepare your wedding at best by seating your guests in the best possible way based on each guest's interaction with the others, by calculating the average mood of the room and assigning each guest a specific seat.

# Seating Optimization Logic

The problem is [NP-Hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) where the goal is to partition the set of `N` guests into `K` tables (groups), each with `M` elements, and assign a table (group index) to each guest.

The tool uses a brute-force recursive algorithm that explores every possible way to assign guests to tables, in order to maximize the average mood at the wedding. Each guest is assigned to one of the tables. For every complete assignment, the algorithm calculates the total mood for each table by summing the pairwise interactions of all guests seated together (as defined in a symmetric `N Ã— N` matrix), and computes the average mood across all non-empty tables.

While this brute-force approach guarantees the optimal result, it does not scale well. This approach explores every possible seating configuration, which leads to an exponential growth in time. For larger inputs, approximations or heuristic-based methods (like greedy search or genetic algorithms) could offer practical runtime improvements with near-optimal results.

# Usage

1. Clone repo

       git clone https://github.com/J4NN0/happy_wedding.git
       cd happy_wedding
       
2. Make sure `banquet.txt` file exists and populate it accordingly
 
   1. First line of the file must contain respectively the values `N` (Number of guests), `K` (Number of tables) and `M` (Tables seats).
   2. The other lines form a symmetric matrix with all zeros in the diagonal (the diagonal of the matrix is zero because the person has no interaction with themselves). The value of each position indicates the interactions of the people with each other. For instance:
 
                  Trump Putin Renzi
            Trump   0    -2     3
            Putin  -2     0     1
            Renzi   3     1     0
  
   3. Names have to not be placed inside the file. Each person is identified by a number which is his position within the file. In the example above, Trump is identified by ID `0`, Putin `1` and Renzi `2`.
  4. The values of the interactions between people should be go from a minimum of `-5` to a maximum of `5`.
  5. An example of a file coudl be the following - `6 (5+1)` the number of guets, `2` the number of tables and `3` tables seats (for each table):
  
            6 2 3
            0 5 3 -2 1 1
            5 0 2 4 3 4
            3 2 0 1 5 -4
            -2 4 1 0 3 3
            1 3 5 3 0 2
            1 4 -4 3 2 0

 3. Make and run the program: the algorithm, through a recursive function, will calculate the average mood of the room and will give you each person's seating. 
 4. So, what are you waiting for? Sit down your guests appropriately!
